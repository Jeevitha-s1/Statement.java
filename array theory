arrays:
Arrays are our first introduction to . An array is a linear group of items of the same type.
For instance, an array could be a group of integers or it could be a group of floating point
numbers, but an array cannot be a mixture of the two. The way that an array is declared
illustrates this property.
int[] myarray = new int[10];
