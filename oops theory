oops:
Object-oriented programming refers to the building of blueprint designs called classes,
and the creation of these classes into objects that can communicate with each other. Each
object contains data elements (variables), and the communication occurs through
method calls from one object to another. In this section, we will discuss some of the
principles of object-oriented programming and how Java implements those principles.
You will learn about inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism
