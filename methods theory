methods:
Other languages call them functions, procedures, or subroutines, but in Java we refer to
the executable parts of a class as methods. Class methods are a focus point in this section.
Instance methods will be discussed in the section on object-oriented programming.
A Java application is a free-standing program that can be executed from a command line.
The main method must be present in all Java applications. This is the starting point for all
applications, and flow of control within the program begins here. As with variables, a
method becomes a class method by the use of the keyword static.
